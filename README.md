# Eastimagic-Least-Squares-Example
This repository contains a notebook which complements the Pull request to estimagic, adding the least squares optimizer from scipy (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html#r20fc1df64af7-jjmore) (make a nice hyperlink). 
The notebook is used as supplementary material for assessment for the course OSE: Scientific Computing for Economists (link and proper citation) in its first itteration in WInder Semester 2020/21, Univesity of Bonn. 
The contents is:
1. An introduction to estimagic and what it does. 
2. The steps used to implement the new internal optimizers
3. The theory behind each of the 3 new aglorithms. 
4. The sphere example from estimagic with the 3 algorithms (maybe comapre which performs better)
5. The example from scipy with the 3 algorithms (maybe which performas better)
6. See if there is a need for a benchmark exercise. 
7. What is the contribution from numerical perspective.
