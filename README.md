# Eastimagic-Least-Squares-Example
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that complements a Pull Request to [estimagic](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic), adding two algorithms from the `least_squares` optimizer from [scipy.optimize.least_squares](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html#r20fc1df64af7-jjmore), namely `scipy_ls_trf` and `scipy_ls_dogbox`. 
The Notebook is used as a supplementary material for assessment for the course [OSE: Scientific Computing](https://ose-scientific-computing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/iteration/lecture_plan_2020.html), Winter Semester 2020/21, Univesity of Bonn by [Prof. Philipp Eisenhauer](https://peisenha.github.io/) within the [Open Source Economics Innitiative](https://open-econ.org/).
